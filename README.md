## springboot-todoapp
A simple TODO application using Spring Boot REST &amp; React JS.

### What I learnt:
- How to use Spring Boot with Java to create REST API Endpoints
- Creating my own API
- How to integrate HSQL with Spring Data JPA
- How to use Lombok, Spring Boot & Hibernate Annotations
- What Components are in ReactJS (and how to create them)
- Fetching from our custom-made API (via axios)
- Front-end integration with Back-end Logic
- React Bootstrap (Form, Dropdown, Modal, etc.)
- Various other React tools (like Router)

### Future Add-Ons:
- Integrate with mySQL (RDBM)
- Testing of the TODO App (via Selenium, Karate, Cucumber)
- Security (via Spring Security — OAuth2)
- Deployment (via AWS, Heroku, or Azure)

### Requirements for this repo:
- Basic understanding in Object Oriented Programming — with Java
